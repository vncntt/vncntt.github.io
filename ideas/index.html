<meta name=theme-color><meta name=description content="Time is limited. These are ideas I&rsquo;ve had, which given infinite time, I would explore.

JARVIS. Models are capable enough already! We just need some better scaffolding like Cursor and some way to fit in a lot of context. I really liked GPT with scheduled tasks. If you patch 20 of these together, you get a really good assistant. One that would be proactive. I don&rsquo;t want to ever miss a call again.
Portable cameraman.
Small, flying, self-adjusting camera? I really dislike taking photos but enjoy looking at them later on.
Surfing footage drone.
Before surfing, I set off a drone which follows me and records cool footage of me catching waves.
Implement needle in a haystack.
I swear my experience with using models don&rsquo;t correspond with the needle in a haystack results they put out.
The current &ldquo;insert random sentence&rdquo; method doesn&rsquo;t seem great either.
Combining facts from the beginning and the end, simple reasoning steps, and
Machine translation through steering vectors?
Give Claude/GPT/&mldr; a decent prompt and scaffolding and let it loose on X.
Taiwanese news is 50% TSMC and gets updates instantly. But it takes a while for this to get to US news outlets. Make a scraper of big Taiwanese outlets and when it&rsquo;s an article about TSMC, automatically translate it to English and post it somewhere.
