&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When I want to build a Chrome extension for personal use, instead of actually learning and writing the JavaScript, I Claude-Code the whole thing in a couple of hours without writing a single line of code.
Instead of taking the usual route which would leave me with more actual familiarity with JavaScript, I now shortcut the process, leaving me with barely any JS knowledge despite numerous functioning applications.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When I need math homework done fast, I feed in the relevant textbook pages in context, dump my problems into o3/Gemini, and check its answers for sanity instead of doing the problems myself. I cram before tests. (Yes, this is morally dubious and terrible for learning.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When I need to write an email, I often bullet-point what I want to write and ask the LLM to write out a coherent, cordial email. I’ve gotten worse at writing emails.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>My first response to most problems is to ask an LLM, and this might atrophy my ability to come up with better solutions since my starting point is already in the LLM-solution space.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These are all deliberate trade-offs I make for the sake of output speed. By sacrificing depth in my learning, I can produce substantially more work. I’m unsure if I’m at the correct balance between output quantity and depth of learning.
This uncertainty is mainly fueled by a sense of urgency due to rapidly improving AI models.
I don’t have time to learn everything deeply. I love learning, but given current trends, I want to maximize immediate output. I’m sacrificing some learning in classes for more time doing outside work. From a teacher’s perspective, this is obviously bad, but from my subjective standpoint, it’s unclear.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>1% Improvements</title><link>https://vvvincent.me/1-improvements/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://vvvincent.me/1-improvements/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a running list of tiny workflow tips that make my day-to-day noticeably smoother.

&lt;li>What do truly long-context models look like?
I want to give the model all my journals, notes, pictures, previous work, etc. so that it can make connections and tailor responses for me.
I imagine this to be In-between context stuffing and fine-tuning. Every ~day, the model takes all the conversations from that day and decides which to use to update its weights. In the future, will everyone have custom models?
Predictive processing?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What will human-AI collaboration look like in the future?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How much software will humans be writing in three years?
What are the comparative advantages of humans?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Is &amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t need to find the most general, all-modality, solution. We just need to get something good enough to automate research. That&amp;rsquo;s the goal. After that, there&amp;rsquo;s a clear path and we&amp;rsquo;re just on high-level steering.&amp;rdquo; wrong?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Has someone created a gym environment that is a computer simulation? Actions are anything someone can do on a computer. After each episode, unit tests are run to determine reward. Why are we using screenshots?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How much does o1-style reasoning RL transfer to performing long-horizon tasks for computer use?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I don&amp;rsquo;t get how we&amp;rsquo;re passing the synthetic data wall. Yes, you can use o3 outputs to fine-tune 4o and get a really good o3-mini, but can you use oN outputs to get oN+1?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Can you get two models to communicate through residual streams and not text? Or CoT in the latent space instead of writing everything out? Is this desirable? How do you get training data for this?
A quick perplexity search &lt;a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/privileged-basis/index.html">gets&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.03230v2">me&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/X26ksz4p3wSyycKNB/gears-level-mental-models-of-transformer-interpretability">these&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gxxqs9/why_should_thoughts_be_word_tokens_in_o1_style/">links&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We have text-to-text, text-to-image, text-to-video. What is the SOTA for text-to-action tokens in robots? There must be a way to leverage the understanding of the world language models have to robotics. How?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How much do traders use ML? It seems like a ripe field for it. Lots of money, data, smart people… Everything is probably private.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Why is Moravec&amp;rsquo;s paradox true?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How is Adam still the best optimizer after 10 years? `&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How do lightweight code-generation models like Cursor&amp;rsquo;s work?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is going on in interpretability these days?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Why are all the benchmarks in math and coding competitions? What happened to physics?&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A &amp;ldquo;See all context&amp;rdquo; button. This is especially useful for reasoning models since I want to know which parts of the reasoning were dropped so I know how much context to provide.
You would have to drop sensitive information like like system prompts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>JARVIS. Models are capable enough already! We just need some better scaffolding like Cursor and some way to fit in a lot of context. I really liked GPT with scheduled tasks. If you patch 20 of these together, you get a really good assistant. One that would be &lt;em>proactive&lt;/em>. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to ever miss a call again.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Surfing footage drone.
Before surfing, I set off a drone which follows me and records cool footage of me catching waves.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Implement needle in a haystack.
I swear my experience with using models don&amp;rsquo;t correspond with the needle in a haystack results they put out.
The current &amp;ldquo;insert random sentence&amp;rdquo; method doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem great either.
Combining facts from the beginning and the end, simple reasoning steps, and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Machine translation through steering vectors?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Give Claude/GPT/&amp;hellip; a decent prompt and scaffolding and let it loose on X.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Taiwanese news is 50% TSMC and gets updates instantly. But it takes a while for this to get to US news outlets. Make a scraper of big Taiwanese outlets and when it&amp;rsquo;s an article about TSMC, automatically translate it to English and post it somewhere.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://aayushg.com/ideas">https://aayushg.com/ideas&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How did my water get here? Enter in a location/building and see where your water source is from.
What pipes did your water go through?
What water plant is it from?
What&amp;rsquo;s the water source?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A script that someone goes through a bunch of websites and stores 404s or unavailables and emails people that some site is down.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>The Man In The Arena&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Best Sport</title><link>https://vvvincent.me/the-best-sport/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2025 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://vvvincent.me/the-best-sport/</guid><description>&lt;p>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a grappling sport which means there is no punching or kicking and you win by gaining dominant positions or submissions such as chokeholds or joint locks.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-makes-bjj-different">What Makes BJJ Different?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>BJJ is the &amp;ldquo;broadest&amp;rdquo; sport I&amp;rsquo;ve done.
It feels like math in the sense that you have so many distinct, but related, concepts to learn and problem-solving to do.
In tennis or basketball, I felt like after building up the basics, I was repetitively honing small details to eek out 1-3% improvements (which can definitely still be fun).
In BJJ, there are black belts who are still not familiar with many positions.
There is definitely still lots of practice spent honing details of specific moves, but it feels like there is more pure learning (compared to refining) going on.
Given any move or position, you can break it down into broad principles, details, counters, and counter counters.
It&amp;rsquo;s a lot like physical chess.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Media I've Enjoyed</title><link>https://vvvincent.me/media-ive-enjoyed/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Dec 2024 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://vvvincent.me/media-ive-enjoyed/</guid><description>&lt;p>obviously non-exhaustive&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Cursor is really powerful. Having never worked with selenium drivers and barely editing any lines of code, I made a &lt;a href="https://github.com/vncntt/webbot">pretty nice scraper&lt;/a> in two afternoons. It just works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, there&amp;rsquo;s a pretty significant distinction of using AI code editors that I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen explicitly stated anywhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first way is tabbing to autocomplete code I&amp;rsquo;ve written hundreds of times, giving me more time for higher-order thinking. This is usually when I&amp;rsquo;m working with programming languages and projects I&amp;rsquo;m already familiar with. I dont see any immediate problems with this.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Principle of Least Action</title><link>https://vvvincent.me/principle-of-least-action/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://vvvincent.me/principle-of-least-action/</guid><description>&lt;p>I thought &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q10_srZ-pbs">this video&lt;/a> was really fun and wrote up some of the derivations that the video went over quickly.&lt;/p>

S_0 = \sum mvs
