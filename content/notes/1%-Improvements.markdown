Here's a running list of tiny workflow tips that make my day-to-day noticeably smoother. 
Most of these are embarrassingly simple, but that's the point!
Habits that seem obvious to me might be totally new to someone else (and vice versa).

I'll keep updating this as I discover more. 
Many are specific to Mac + Chrome.
Feel free to message me your favorites and I'll include them!

1. ```Cmd+l``` to get to search bar
2. `Cmd+1, Cmd+2, ...` to navigate between tabs
3. `Cmd+` ` to get around windows of the same app without the slow Mac sliding animation. Your windows have to be non-maximized.
4. `Tab+Enter` to fill out forms without using your mouse. `Tab+"Answer"` where you type the answers out from a dropdown menu works too.
5. `Cmd+Shift+m` -> Arrow keys -> `Enter` to navigate between different Google accounts
6. Raycast
   - Clipboard history (I don't use it that much)
   - Window management: I bound `Cmd+Shift+j/k` to left/right half for window management.
   - Snippets: I bound `@@` and `!@` to common emails.
7. A goddamn mouse
8. [Dell 32 inch curved monitor](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-32-curved-4k-uhd-monitor-s3221qs/apd/210-axkm/monitors-monitor-accessories)
9. If your LLM starts generating a response and you realize you missed something, edit your original message directly instead of sending a follow-up correction. It keeps the conversation cleaner.
10. I bound Vim's copy to clipboard (`"+y`) `\`. There are definitely a ton of vimrc shenanegans that I'm not abusing. Send me your favorite ones!
11. You can use your iPad as an extended display to your Mac without any setup! (not knowing about this sparked me writing this post)
