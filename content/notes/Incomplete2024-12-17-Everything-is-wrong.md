This idea has been mulling around in my head in various forms for a while:

- Everything is wrong
- Nuance
- Dualities
- [Reverse any advice you hear](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/24/should-you-reverse-any-advice-you-hear/)
- Levels of abstraction
- There is no "wrong" advice, only personalized advice.

This manifests in my thought process as a 


This had led to me to not have strong takes on things anymore which seems wrong too. 

I've also heard others talk about this [as](https://x.com/morqon/status/1667717155234758657) [well](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/almost-everything-ive-written-seems?utm_source=%2Finbox&utm_medium=reader2). 

What does this imply? 
The advice you are giving now will likely be wrong to future you?
You shouldn't be giving advice?
You shouldn't have strong takes on things ?

I think it's obvious that everyone becoming a middleman without strong takes is not a good world.
Much of progress is started by a small group of people adamantly pushing contraversial ideas. 

Being wrong about things is inevitable and is part of the process of eventually getting to what is real.
It's an important part of the learning process.
