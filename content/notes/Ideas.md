Some ideas I find interesting but don't have enough time to make a reality.


- A "See all context" button. This is especially useful for reasoning models since I want to know which parts of the reasoning were dropped so I know how much context to provide.
You would have to drop sensitive information like like system prompts. 
- JARVIS. Models are capable enough already! We just need some better scaffolding like Cursor and some way to fit in a lot of context. I really liked GPT with scheduled tasks. If you patch 20 of these together, you get a really good assistant. One that would be *proactive*. I don't want to ever miss a call again.
- Surfing footage drone. 
Before surfing, I set off a drone which follows me and records cool footage of me catching waves.
- Implement needle in a haystack. 
I swear my experience with using models don't correspond with the needle in a haystack results they put out.
The current "insert random sentence" method doesn't seem great either.
Combining facts from the beginning and the end, simple reasoning steps, and 
- Machine translation through steering vectors?
- Give Claude/GPT/... a decent prompt and scaffolding and let it loose on X.
- Taiwanese news is 50% TSMC and gets updates instantly. But it takes a while for this to get to US news outlets. Make a scraper of big Taiwanese outlets and when it's an article about TSMC, automatically translate it to English and post it somewhere.

- How did my water get here? Enter in a location/building and see where your water source is from. 
What pipes did your water go through?
What water plant is it from?
What's the water source?
- A script that someone goes through a bunch of websites and stores 404s or unavailables and emails people that some site is down.
