Time is limited. These are ideas I've had, which given infinite time, I would explore.



- JARVIS. Models are capable enough already! We just need some better scaffolding like Cursor and some way to fit in a lot of context. I really liked GPT with scheduled tasks. If you patch 20 of these together, you get a really good assistant. One that would be *proactive*. I don't want to ever miss a call again.

- Machine translation through steering vectors?
