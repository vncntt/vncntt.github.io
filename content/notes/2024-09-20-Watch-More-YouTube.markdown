Many people have written about curating a very [good](https://near.blog/how-to-twitter-successfully/) [Twitter](https://nabeelqu.co/twitter) [feed](https://near.blog/how-to-twitter-successfully/), but I have yet to see anyone talk about doing this with Youtube. I don't know if many people do it but don't talk about it, don't do it, or what. I guess "subscribe to tons of accounts you enjoy, use the "Not Interested" for ones you want to avoid, and harvest" is not very deep. 

YouTubeâ€™s algorithm is very good at recommending content you would enjoy and Iâ€™ve more consciously used that to curate my YouTube feed towards content I enjoy (mostly technical). I've discovered high-quality channels with fewer than 1k subscribers that wouldn't have appeared in my feed if I hadn't been more intentional. As a result, my YouTube feed feels like a mix of a science fair, machine learning conference, math club, hackathon, and symposium.

This isn't limited to technical content. Use different Google accounts for different interests. Merge your interests. I have another YouTube account that is for other misc stuff I enjoy like movie reviews, poker, music, and BJJ. The general lesson is you can intentionally curate anything (YouTube, Spotify, Instagram, social communities) towards anything you enjoy (math, art, bjj, music, memes). Take control of the recommendation algorithms instead of letting them control you.


Below are all my Youtube subscriptions on the Math/CS account (updated 2024-09-20). [Tell me](https://x.com/vvvincent_c) if I'm missing any good ones!
