Hey! I'm Vincent Cheng, an freshman Math-CS major at UCSD. I've attended [Ross](https://rossprogram.org/), [WARP](warp.camp), [IOAI](https://ioai-official.org/), and was an [2023 Atlas fellow](https://www.atlasfellowship.org/).
I change my mind about things very often, but wanting to learn new things is a constant! I'm interested in math, ML, what the future with AI will look like, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, arm-wrestling, and meeting new people. Message/email me!


I read a lot of articles and save them in my [Curius bookshelf](https://curius.app/vincent-cheng)! Check it out and get Curius yourself too.


Want to know what I'm up to right now? Check out my [now page](https://vncntt.github.io/now/).
