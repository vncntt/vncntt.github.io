Hey, I'm Vincent!
I was a freshman at UCSD and am a sophomore studying math at Cornell now.

I change my mind about things very often, but wanting to learn new things is a constant! I'm especially interested in math, ML, AI safety, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and meeting new people. Message or email me if you want to talk!

Things I've been a part of and enjoyed: [Ross](https://rossprogram.org/), [WARP](https://www.warp.camp/), [Atlas](https://www.atlasfellowship.org/), [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/@veritasium) (I worked there part time for six months. Message me to hear the story!).
