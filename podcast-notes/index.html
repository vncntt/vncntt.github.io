Jeff talked about how it would be nice to make &ldquo;surgical incisions&rdquo; into the model: re-train some modules, add some connections here and there, and just a lot more flexibility.

Dennard scaling was still intact. But now when you move from 5 nanometer to 3 nanometer, you don&rsquo;t double density. SRAM doesn&rsquo;t scale at all. Logic does scale, but it&rsquo;s like 30%. All in all, you only save about 20% in power per transistor. But because of data locality and movement of data, you actually get a much larger improvement in power efficiency by moving to the next node than just the individual transistors&rsquo; power efficiency benefit. For example, if you&rsquo;re multiplying a matrix that&rsquo;s 8,000 by 8,000 by 8,000, you can&rsquo;t fit that all on one chip. But if you could fit more and more, you have to move off chip less, go to memory less, etc. The data locality helps a lot too.</p></blockquote><ul><li>if china invades taiwan, we will not be thinking about ai. cars, phones, screens, everything using electronics will be fucked</li></ul><p>How does one learn about semiconductors?</p><ul><li><p>there aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;18 year old dropout turned engineer at openai"s in the semiconductor industry</p></li><li><p>everything is so fucking specialized it&rsquo;s harder to break in</p></li><li><p>AI is new. all the frontier methods are on the Internet.
