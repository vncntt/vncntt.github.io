VaccinateCA:
- centralize information about where to get vaccines
- started as a random hackathon project between friends at 10 pm
- became biggest site for this in US
- why wasn’t this done by the government?
    - no one called this specifically their responsibility
    - everybody only wanted to do some part, but not the whole thing so no one even started
- big tech companies didn’t do this because they didn’t want to appear more competent than the government then gov looks poorly on them + get bad business???
- copenhagen principle: the person doing anything gets responsibility for everything -> person doing anything gets more hate than person doing nothing. touching the problem immediately takes liability for all problems
- discord servers > government, health agencies, big tech lmao
- example of how EMH is usually wrong
- this is an example of real INSANE agency
- the US government has abdicated software as a core responsibility
- Tiering system for vaccines
    - Tier 1A (healthcare professionals, 75+, vets), 1B (school teachers (??), 1C (ppl who will probably die if the get COVID)
    - no one talks about how prioritization killed people. 
- how much did cultural factors (wokeness, BLM, …) play a factor?
- **california only successfully injected 25% of their vaccines**
- government could’ve given amazon the job of transporting viles in cool temp. they’re good at transporting things
- to protect the integrity of the tiering system, people threw out shots rather than giving it to someone not next in the queue
- people in tech need to get better at working with the government

What is crypto good for?
- the value hasn’t arrived yet. they’ve used hundreds of billions of dollars, but how much value have they actually produced? thinking about crypto in terms of resources consumed vs value produced. if it was another tech company, it would’ve failed already. ai….?
- what’s kyc, aml? know-your-customer. anti-money laundering
- all transaction errors have to be monitored. banks have intelligence-agency-sized groups of people writing memos no one is gonna read. what
- crypto uses privacy questionably

Government + big tech
- should the tech industry be part of the government?

what is this choosing to have nice things?

Financial plumbing:
- how hard is money laundering?
- the most sophisticated money launderer was sbf. he laundered tens of billions of dollars without being caught. he just ended up losing the money
- how to launder money? establish shell corp then buy real estate somewhere then rent houses to ppl then earn clean money. money put in is wired to a lawyer? confused

Maximizing value
- “most people don’t charge enough for their services”
- in some pro-capitalist cultures, there is less engrained skepticism about accumulating resources as a goal. not true for others. culture clashes cause weird stuff?
- salary negotiation. you have no less right to the marginal dollar compared to a company. agency thing?
- his article has literally earned ppl money totaling 8 figures every year

Young people
- there are less people in their 20s with prominent software businesses now compared to 10 years ago. is this true?
- holy shit patrick has played 4-6k hours of video games
- sammy mention
- a lot of factorio hype
- wtf. he had 68 direct reports in his WoW raid guilds. video games be wild

Thinking well
- good writing is good thinking.
- what did founders spend too much effort overoptimizing on? status

Blameless post-mortems
