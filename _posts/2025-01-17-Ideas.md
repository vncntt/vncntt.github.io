Time is limited. These are ideas I've had, which given infinite time, I would explore.



- JARVIS. Models are capable enough already! We just need some better scaffolding like Cursor and some way to fit in a lot of context. I really liked GPT with scheduled tasks. If you patch 20 of these together, you get a really good assistant. One that would be *proactive*. I don't want to ever miss a call again.
- Portable cameraman. 
Small, flying, self-adjusting camera? I really dislike taking photos but enjoy looking at them later on. 
- Surfing footage drone. 
Before surfing, I set off a drone which follows me and records cool footage of me catching waves.
- Implement needle in a haystack. 
I swear my experience with using models don't correspond with the needle in a haystack results they put out.
The current "insert random sentence" method doesn't seem great either.
Combining facts from the beginning and the end, simple reasoning steps, and 
- Machine translation through steering vectors?
