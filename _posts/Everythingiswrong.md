Everything is wrong
Nuance
Dualities
Reverse all advice you hear
Different levels of abstraction
If you think it's wrong, you just have a skill issue or aren't doing it right. When you claim that 
"X" doesn't work, you're just not going it right (bjj moves, whatnot). if you say "oh, you can't 
learn math really fast or say learn a new language really fast and someone actually does it, you're just wrong."
