Some weird stuff happens in high-dimensions.

Consider an $n$-dimensional cube of side length 1 containing a smaller $n$-dimensional cube with side length $0.8$ ("pulp") surrounded by a $0.1$-width border ("peel"). 

The volume of the pulp is $0.8^n$, which rapidly approaches 0 as $n$ increases:


| Dimensions | Pulp Volume ($0.8^n$) |
|------------|------------------------|
| 1          | 0.800                 |
| 2          | 0.640                 |
| 3          | 0.512                 |
| 5          | 0.328                 |
| 10         | 0.107                 |
| 20         | 0.012                 |
| 50         | 0.000014              |

[Another perspective](https://x.com/Jsevillamol/status/1817213852402303024): To randomly sample a point in this cube, we select $n$ independent coordinates from $[0,1]$. The point lies in the pulp only if all coordinates fall within $(0.1, 0.9)$. This probability is $(0.8)^n$, approaching 0 as $n$ increases.

In high dimensions, the volume is almost all in the surface.

This is very weird and requires non-trivial math to show.

[Drake](https://x.com/MaskedTorah/status/1818188397087015147) came up with a good explanation which is explained [here](https://x.com/RokoMijic/status/1818273024526733319)
