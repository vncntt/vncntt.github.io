I'm Vincent Cheng, an incoming freshman at math + cs major at UCSD. I was an [Atlas fellow](https://www.atlasfellowship.org/) in 2023, attended [WARP](warp.camp) in 2024, and I want to learn everything. Some of my specific interests are  

- Learning more math 
- Getting better at coding
- Making ML models
- Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu
- Arm-wrestling
