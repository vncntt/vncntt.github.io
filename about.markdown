I'm Vincent Cheng, an incoming freshman Math-CS major at UCSD. I attended [2023 Ross Indiana](https://rossprogram.org/), was an [2023 Atlas fellow](https://www.atlasfellowship.org/), attended [WARP](warp.camp), [IOAI](https://ioai-official.org/). 
I change my mind about things very often, but wanting to learn new things is a constant! I'm interested in math, ML, what the AI future looks like, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, arm-wrestling, 


I read a lot of articles and they're all stored in my [Curius bookshelf](https://curius.app/vincent-cheng)! Check it out and get Curius yourself too!
