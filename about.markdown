I'm Vincent Cheng, an incoming freshman at math + cs major at UCSD. I attended [2023 Ross Indiana](https://rossprogram.org/), was an [2023 Atlas fellow](https://www.atlasfellowship.org/), and attended [WARP](warp.camp) in 2024. I want to get good at everything! Some of my interests are  

- Learning more math 
- Becoming a technical generalist 
- ML
- Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu
- Arm-wrestling
