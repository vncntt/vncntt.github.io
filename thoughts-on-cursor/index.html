Cursor is really powerful. Having never worked with selenium drivers and barely editing any lines of code, I made a pretty nice scraper in two afternoons. It just works.
However, there&rsquo;s a pretty significant distinction of using AI code editors that I haven&rsquo;t seen explicitly stated anywhere.
The first way is tabbing to autocomplete code I&rsquo;ve written hundreds of times, giving me more time for higher-order thinking.

I dont see any immediate problems with this.</p><p>The second way is when I&rsquo;m not writing much code but rather prompting and then copy-pasting long blocks of code which I don&rsquo;t fully understand.
This feels magical because I see results immediately, when normally I would&rsquo;ve had to learn some syntax, read some tutorials, and crawled through docs.</p><p>But, when the codebase gets larger, my cracks in understanding compound and I hit a bug where I&rsquo;m just lost.
I can iteratively prompt the model asking it to help me with debugging, but I&rsquo;m almost entirely limited by the ability of the model.
I can&rsquo;t take the reins myself from this point either since I didn&rsquo;t really know what was going on the entire time.
Good prompting can take you much further, but often not enough.</p><p>It&rsquo;s comparable to cheating on a test where you&rsquo;re taking a shortcut to a good grade.
However, I see more merit (though not endorsing) to cheating in a class you have no interest in (purely to graduate) where you&rsquo;re just saving time for yourself versus some important class that builds out on the foundations for the future.</p><p>This has happened to me where I&rsquo;m trying to learn something with Cursor but I&rsquo;m offloading to omany details which means bugs are hard to fix and I end up having to go back and rewrite much of the code anyways.</p><p>My conclusion is that Cursor is insane for creating one-off pieces of code when I want to get things working really fast, but unhelpful (even harmful) when I want to learn something from the fundamentals.</p><p>However, there&rsquo;s also the argument that models are improving extremely fast and agents better than 99.9% of software engineers are not far away. By then, technical details probably aren&rsquo;t very relevant.
